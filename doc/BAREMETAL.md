## Booting Composite kernel on Bare-metal (x86)

Composite kernel can be booted up from any bootloader that supports Multiboot specification.
I've tested it on Grub2 (with Ubuntu 14.04) and Grub-legacy (with Ubuntu 9.04)
* With Grub2, there is some problem loading Composite kernel. One guess is, it could be something to do with Load address of Composite being 0xC0100000. Gave up on this for the moment. 
* With Grub-legacy, Composite boot up is fine but there is sad news. (TODO)

*PS: I guess, you could just install Grub-legacy on Ubuntu 14.04 but I've not tried that yet. Instead I've dual boot with 9.04 which supports Grub-legacy.*

### HowTo work with Grub-legacy

In order to boot from Grub-legacy, do the following: 

* Add an entry in to the /boot/grub/menu.lst.

```
title 	Composite kernel
	kernel	/boot/co_kernel.img
    module	/boot/40800000-40800870
    quiet
```
**Note** For this to work, there is some work to do in Composite src ;)
	- src/platform/i386/kernel.c has to be modified to ignore the '/boot/' in the module command line. 
	- And do the following:
		1. You have to copy the composite kernel image and the module to /boot/. 
		2. You may need to rename your kernel.img or edit 'kernel' line above to match what you've.
		3. You have to make sure that the name of the module in menu.lst is same as module generated by 'micro_boot.sh'.

* After this is done, save menu.lst and reboot the PC. 
* Select 'Composite kernel' from Grub-legacy bootloader... Done.. Composite boots!! ???
* Not really, but we'll get there eventually.. :) It's a long way to the top if you wanna rock and roll (AC-DC). :P 

### Debug: Console or VGA 

TODO: Add/modify vga driver in Composite kernel. I've to first make sure that the code I wrote isn't violating any Composite coding style, takes time! There is reading, there is coding, there is testing before I could commit! ;)

### Debug: Serial

I've not used it as there is some serial compatibility issues, need a serial cable with female connectors at both end to connect 2 PCs or a USB at one end! That didn't work out well!
